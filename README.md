# Generalized-Tictactoe (TTT)

Generalized TTT, also know as The m, n, k-game, is a generalization of TTT played on an board with m rows and n columns. Players try to get k in row either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Well-known versions of the game are TTT which is (3,3,3) and Gomoku which is either (15,15,5) or (19, 19, 5).

The initial programming will be in Python probably using Tkinter for the GUI.

Things to do

Post my text TTT game.
Post generalized matrix and first programming ideas.
Write up some short and long term goals for the description.

Some goals

Write a text version of the generalized game that allows two human players to play the game.
Write a GUI version using Tkinter.
Write a version so that a human can play the computer.
Use machine learning to create an AI version of the game.
