# Generalized-Tictactoe (TTT)

Generalized TTT, also know as The m, n, k-game, is a generalization of TTT played on an board with m rows and n columns. Players try to get k in row either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Well-known versions of the game are TTT which is (3,3,3) and Gomoku which is either (15,15,5) or (19, 19, 5).

The initial programming will be in Python probably using Tkinter for the GUI.

Another interesting generalization is Harary’s 3-dimensional version of
tic-tac-toe:

We begin with the following converntions and structure.  The board is a numpy array of integers. An empty square is represent by a 0. The first player’s moves are  represented by 1. The second player's moves are represented by -1. We adopt the convention that the squares are represented by a tuple of integers (row, col). We will also use the convention that the squares are numbered from 1 to (number of rows) x (number of columns) starting at the upper left and moving across a row then to the next row.

Short-term goals
(1) Create a function ListGames(m,n) that generates a file with all possible "games."   A "game" is a board filled with x's and o's such that the number of x's is either equal to the number o's or greater by 1 depending on whether there are a odd or even number of squares.  This functions will be useful for finding won and drawn games.   We can use this list for later attempts at machine learning.

(2) Create a function In_a_Row(square) that takes a square on the board and returns how many of the mark on that square there are in a row. If the square is empty it returns 0.  

Some long-term goals
(1) Write a text version of the generalized game that allows two human players to play the game.
(2) Write a GUI version using Tkinter.
(3) Write a version so that a human can play aqainst the program.
(4) Use machine learning to create an AI version of the game.
