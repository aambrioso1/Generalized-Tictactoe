# Create a function ListGames(m,n) that generates a file with all possible "games."   A "game" is a board completely filled with x's and o's such that the number of x's is either equal to the number o's or greater by 1 depending on whether there are an even or odd number of squares.   This functions will be useful for finding won and drawn games.   We can use the list for later attempts at machine learning.
