# We begin with the following structure.
# The board is a numpy array of integers.
# An empty square is represent is empty.
# The first playerâ€™s moves are  represented by 1.
# The second player's moves are represented by 0.
# We adopt the convention that the squares are represented by a tuple of integers (row, col).
# We will also use the convention that the squares are numbered from 1 to (number of rows) x (number of columns) starting at the
# upper left and moving across a row then to the next row.
