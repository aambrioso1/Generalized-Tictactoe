# We begin with the follow structure.
# The board is a numpy array of integers.
# An empty square is represent by a 0.
# The first playerâ€™s moves are  represented by 1.
# The second player's moves are represented by -1.
# We adopt the convention that the squares are respresented by a tuple of integers (row, col).
# Also useful is the convention that the squares are numbered from 1 to m x n starting at the
# upper left and move across a row then to the next row.

import numpy as np

# Initialize the board array with m rows and n columns.
m = 3
n = 3

for i in range(m):

# Need to generalize and automate the construction of this dictionary with zip().
