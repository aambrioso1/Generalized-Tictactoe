# We begin with the follow structure. 
# The board is a numpy array of integers.
# An empty square is represent by a 0.
# The first playerâ€™s moves are  represented by 1.
# The second player's moves are represented by -1.
# We adopt the convention that the squares are respresented by a tuple of integers (row, col).
# Also useful is the convention that the squares are numbered from 1 to m x n starting at the
# upper left and move across a row then to the next row.
