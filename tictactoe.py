"""
Tic-Tac-Toe Program based on a program found here:
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-implementation-automatic-tic-tac-toe-game-using-random-number/

The sise of the board is arbitrary and controlled by the size variable.

The user can input moves based on the move dictionary:  { 1: (0,0), 2: (0, 1), ...}.

Players are:  
1 for X (moves first)
2 for O (moves second)

Outcomes are indicated as follows:
Winner is: 1
Winner is: 2
Winner is: -1 if its a draw (cat's game)

Has nice imput checking in the make_a_move function using the try statement and exception handlling.


If the function make_a_move(board, player) is commented out and random_place(board, player) is put back in CPU will play both sides with random moves.
